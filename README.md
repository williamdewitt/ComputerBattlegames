# Computer Battlegames

The code in the project is a learning exercise.  The idea inspired first by the YouTube video [Programming Retro Games in Python | 80s Usborne Computer Coding Book](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kdM9wyglnw) and then by the book [Usborne Computer Battlegames](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bxv0SsvibDMTVUExUjFhTURCSU0/view?usp=sharing&resourcekey=0-v2liG0G60g8b7DXjJtDBXg).  The book is a collection of games to type in and play on a computer.  The games are written in BASIC and are designed to be played on a BBC Microcomputer.  The games are simple and fun to play.  The games are also a great way to learn how to program.

Additional books can be found [here](https://usborne.com/za/books/computer-and-coding-books).

The games adapeted here to C#.

## How to run the games

1. Clone the repository
2. For now, navigate to the game you want to play in the terminal and run `dotnet run`
3. A future exercise will be to create a console application that will allow you to select the game you want to play.
