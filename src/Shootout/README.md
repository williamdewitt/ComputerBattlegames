# Shootout

You are standing back to back.  You take 10 paces, turn and reachf or your gun.  How quick are you?  Can you shoot first?

Your computer prints the numbers 1 to 10 to represent the 10 paces, pauses and then print HE DRAWS...  You must be ready to press a key (any one will do) the instant these words come on the screen.  If you are quick enough, you will win.  Don't press a key before HE DRAWS comes up or you will automatically lose.

## Adding to the program

Can you adjust the time you have to react to the message and press a key?

## Making the game harder

Can you add the possibility of missing sometimes?

Here is the example BASIC code.

## Puzzle corner

See if you can work out how to make it possible for the computer to miss too.
