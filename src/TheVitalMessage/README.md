If you relay it correctly, the Robot attack will be crushed.  This game tests your skill ar remembering a group of letters which you see for only a very short time.  The computer will ask you for a difficulty from 4 to 10.  When you have typed in your answer, letters will appear top left of your screen and disappear again fairly quickly.
